## About 

This project consists of creating our own library. It includes some functions of C Standard Library such as strlen, strcat etc...

It also includes my own (partially implemented) printf and some custom functions added over time.

## Implementation

Straightforward function by function case. Implemented each function in it's own *.c file and created a makefile to compile everything into 'libft.a'.

## Use

This project has been used in almost all my 42 projects since we are allowed very limited use of in built or external library's.

To use this library cd into libft folder and use "make all" to compile the library into 'libft.a' and compile it it with your own *.c file/s.

## Edits

Removed *_bonus files for convenience in other projects.

Added ft_printf.
